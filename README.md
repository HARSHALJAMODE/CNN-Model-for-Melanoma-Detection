## Problem statement

To build a CNN based model which can accurately detect melanoma. Melanoma is a type of cancer that can be deadly if not detected early. It accounts for 75% of skin cancer deaths. A solution that can evaluate images and alert dermatologists about the presence of melanoma has the potential to reduce a lot of manual effort needed in diagnosis.

## Conclusions
- Data augmentation helps to reduce the overfitting.

- After Data augmentation the Accuracy on both training and validation data have been increased as shown below.
